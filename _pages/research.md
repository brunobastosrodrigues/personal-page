<div style="margin-bottom:1.7em;">
  My research investigates secure and privacy-aware sensing systems in the Internet of Things (IoT), focusing on how we perceive, interpret, and act on physical world information through digital systems. I am particularly interested in <strong>passive sensing</strong>, <strong>multi-modal data fusion</strong>, and <strong>cyber-physical security</strong> in constrained environments such as smart homes, logistics hubs, and public spaces.

### Research Themes

- **Passive Sensing and Tracking**  
  Leveraging BLE, Wi-Fi, ZigBee, and LiDAR signals to unobtrusively track people and assets without requiring their active cooperation. Applications include occupancy analytics, behavior modeling, and crowd flow analysis.

- **Privacy-Preserving Perception Systems**  
  Designing systems that ensure user privacy through selective sensing (e.g., depth-only LiDAR), anonymized signal processing, and differential handling of personal data.

- **Secure IoT and Cyber-Physical Systems**  
  Developing methods to identify and mitigate cyber threats like DDoS attacks and unauthorized profiling by securing the communication and behavioral footprint of IoT devices.

- **Multi-Modal Sensor Fusion**  
  Combining heterogeneous sensor data (RF, LiDAR, thermal, etc.) to enhance robustness, reduce noise, and support contextual awareness in real-world deployments.

### Research Projects Experience

#### PasWITS – Passive Wireless Tracking Intelligence System</span> (2020–2022)  
Funded by Innosuisse, this project developed a privacy-preserving localization system using BLE and Wi-Fi signals. I led the architectural design, coordinated student development, and oversaw prototype testing in collaboration with an industry partner.

#### H2020 CONCORDIA – Cybersecurity Competence Network</span> (2019–2022)  
A European effort to build collaborative cybersecurity capacity. I contributed to distributed network defense (Task 1.2), the economics of cybersecurity (Task 4.1), and piloted the DDoS Clearing House for Europe (Task 3.2).

#### BC4CC – Blockchain-Based Cold Chain Monitoring</span> (2018–2019)  
Swiss KTI project focused on pharmaceutical cold chain monitoring. I helped to design the interoperability framework that matches policy constraints to optimal blockchain platforms, ensuring cost-efficient and reliable data logging.

#### E2C – Energy Efficiency to Clouds</span> (2015–2016)  
Part of the Laboratory of Sustainability in ICT (USP). Developed resource allocation strategies tailored to energy-aware user profiles, and coordinated the research group’s technical activities.

#### SOS – Sustainability-Oriented SDN Policies</span> (2014–2015)  
Developed an SDN-based control system for energy-efficient networking. This included dynamic policy refinement and deploying sustainable operational strategies for data center infrastructure.

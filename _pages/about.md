*Empowering real-world systems through secure, privacy-aware sensing and network intelligence*
<br>

### Affiliation
I am a *tenure-track Assistant Professor for Embedded Sensing Systems and Industrial Networks* at the Institute of Computer Science in Vorarlberg [(ICV)](https://icv.unisg.ch/), School of Computer Science [(SCS)](https://www.unisg.ch/de/universitaet/schools/computer-science/), University of St. Gallen [(HSG)](https://www.unisg.ch/en/), Switzerland.

### Research Focus
My research and teaching bridge theory and practice in IoT, wireless sensor networks, and network security—focusing on how we sense, protect, and interact with the world through connected devices.

### Short bio
Before joining HSG, I received my doctoral degree from the University of Zurich in 2020, where I also worked as a postdoctoral researcher until 2024. My PhD work focused on collaborative signaling systems to counter Distributed Denial-of-Service (DDoS) attacks, while my postdoctoral [research](https://www.alexandria.unisg.ch/handle/20.500.14171/123223) explored passive tracking and tracing using radio signals and assessing their impact on privacy.

Prior to my PhD, I worked as a research assistant at the University of São Paulo (USP), Brazil. From 2013 to 2016, I participated in collaborative research projects between USP and Ericsson Research, resulting in several publications. Specifically, my MSc thesis focused on energy efficiency and management in software-defined networks and cloud environments. During my BSc at the University of the State of Santa Catarina (UDESC), I focused on cloud computing security and the analysis of large-scale distributed systems.

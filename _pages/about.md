I am an Assistant Professor of Embedded Sensing Systems at the [Institute of Computer Science in Vorarlberg (ICV)](https://icv.unisg.ch/), University of St. Gallen (HSG). My research and teaching cover real-world sensing, IoT, wireless sensor networks, and network security, bridging theoretical models with practical systems.

Before joining HSG, I received my doctoral degree from the University of Zurich, in 2020, where I worked as a postdoctoral researcher until 2024. While my [PhD work](https://www.zora.uzh.ch/id/eprint/203554/1/203554.pdf)
 had a focus on a collaborative signaling information system to counter Distributed Denial-of-Service (DDoS), my postdoctoral research focused had a particular focus on [passive tracking and tracing](https://www.alexandria.unisg.ch/handle/20.500.14171/123223) techniques using radio signals observing their impacts on privacy of citizens.

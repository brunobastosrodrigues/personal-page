I am an Assistant Professor of Embedded Sensing Systems at the Institute of Computer Science in Vorarlberg (ICV), University of St. Gallen (HSG).

My research and teaching cover real-world sensing, IoT, wireless sensor networks, and network security, bridging theoretical models with practical systems.

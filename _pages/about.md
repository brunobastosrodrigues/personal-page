*Empowering real-world systems through secure, privacy-aware sensing and network intelligence.*

I am a *tenure-track Assistant Professor of Embedded Sensing Systems* at the  
<a href="https://icv.unisg.ch/" target="_blank">Institute of Computer Science in Vorarlberg (ICV)</a>,  
<a href="https://www.unisg.ch/de/universitaet/schools/computer-science/" target="_blank">School of Computer Science (SCS)</a>,  
University of St. Gallen (HSG), Switzerland.

My research and teaching bridge theory and practice in IoT, wireless sensor networks, and network security—focusing on how we sense, protect, and interact with the world through connected devices.

  <strong>Research focus:</strong>
  Secure and privacy-preserving sensing, passive tracking, and multi-modal data fusion in cyber-physical systems for smart environments, logistics, and healthcare.

Before joining HSG, I received my doctoral degree from the University of Zurich in 2020, where I also worked as a postdoctoral researcher until 2024. My <a href="https://www.zora.uzh.ch/id/eprint/203554/1/203554.pdf" target="_blank">PhD work</a> focused on collaborative signaling systems to counter Distributed Denial-of-Service (DDoS) attacks, while my postdoctoral research explored <a href="https://www.alexandria.unisg.ch/handle/20.500.14171/123223" target="_blank">passive tracking and tracing</a> using radio signals and assessing their impact on privacy.
